# NOTME

<img src="notme.svg" width="128" alt="NOTME Logo" />

A Discord bot made for Hack Club Siege. Depending on future themes, I will either continue developing it during Siege, or wait for the end.

The name is certainly not a reference to that one other Discord bot that sucks but is also one of the most popular bots on the platform.
### Week 1: Gambling!  
Currently only slots, but I have plans for Blackjack and Holdem.

## Usage

Just create a .env file, add `TOKEN=<token>`, then 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
